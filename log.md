##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: January 17th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Got started with Vue JS crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs. Ended at timestamp: 24:38.

**Thoughts**: I got much further than I did the last time I attempted to follow along with this walkthrough, I couldn't even get VUe to work from the CDN. I feel much better!

### Day 1: January 18th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Vue JS crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs. Ended at timestamp: 45:55.

**Thoughts**: Today we started to create components, a term I had heard a lot but didn't really understand. There's a concept I still haven't fully grasped yet, and thats import and export. I'll definitely need to keep working with them to get more comfortable. I have also been using "v-bind" a lot. This is clearly an import part of Vue and I would like ot do further research and learn exactly what that means and what are the other major Vue concepts there are. Also want to read up more on "Props" Regardless, I'm happy with my progress.
